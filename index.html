    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        My journey into the world of computers began early, back in primary school, thanks to a partnership between Egerton University and the Rockefeller Foundation.
        That spark of curiosity turned into a passion that has guided me ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
        In high school at Chepseon Secondary School, a computer-studies-centric institution, I fully immersed myself in learning. I excelled in the KCSE Computer Studies course, became the Computer Lab Prefect,
        and also completed a digital literacy program offered by Computers for Schools Kenya (CFSK).
    </p>
    <p>
        Although I went on to study Analytical Chemistry at the Rift Valley Institute of Science and Technology—following some career advice I later reconsidered—my true calling remained in technology.
        I briefly worked in the chemical industry, then took up roles in sales and customer service at organizations like House of Leather, Horizon Contact Centers, and currently, Calltronix Kenya Ltd.
    </p>
    <p>
        Working in customer service reconnected me with my passion. I discovered new learning tools like ChatGPT and realized that modern technology can be a powerful partner in learning.
        That reignited my dream to become a developer—something I’d wanted since high school.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, I’m a self-taught developer with over two years of freelancing-style learning under my belt. I specialize in Python programming and have practical knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        While I often leverage AI-generated code, I know how to understand, adapt, and use it effectively in real-world contexts.
    </p>
    <p>
        For me, programming is about breathing life into ideas—mine and yours. I'm still growing, and while I haven’t built a fully-fledged application yet, I’m working toward that goal every day.
        Whether on my own or with a dedicated team in the future, I aspire to build compelling, problem-solving applications and help individuals and businesses bring their ideas online.
